	//To create an empty map, use the builtin make: make(map[key-type]val-type)

	//Set key/value pairs using typical name[key] = val syntax.

	//Printing a map with e.g. fmt.Println will show all of its key/value pairs

	//Get a value for a key with name[key]

	//The builtin len returns the number of key/value pairs when called on a map

	//The builtin delete removes key/value pairs from a map

	//The optional second return value when getting a value from a map indicates if the key was present in the map. This can be used to disambiguate between missing keys and keys with zero values like 0 or "". Here we didnâ€™t need the value itself, so we ignored it with the blank identifier _

	//You can also declare and initialize a new map in the same line with this syntax

	//Note that maps appear in the form map[k:v k:v] when printed with fmt.Println
