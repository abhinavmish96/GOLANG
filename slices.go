//Slices are a key data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays

func main() {

	//Unlike arrays, slices are typed only by the elements they contain (not the number of elements). To create an empty slice with non-zero length, use the builtin *make*. Here we make a slice of strings of length 3 (initially zero-valued)
	s:= make([]string, 3)
	fmt.Println("emp: ", s)

	//We can set and get just like with arrays
	s[0] = "a"

	//len returns the length of the slice as expected.

	//In addition to these basic operations, slices support several more that make them richer than arrays. One is the builtin append, which returns a slice containing one or more new values. Note that we need to accept a return value from append as we may get a new slice value

	//Slices can also be copy’d. Here we create an empty slice c of the same length as s and copy into c from s

	//Slices support a “slice” operator with the syntax slice[low:high]. For example, this gets a slice of the elements s[2], s[3], and s[4]

	//This slices up to (but excluding) s[5]

	//And this slices up from (and including) s[2]

	//We can declare and initialize a variable for slice in a single line as well.

	//Slices can be composed into multi-dimensional data structures. The length of the inner slices can vary, unlike with multi-dimensional arrays
