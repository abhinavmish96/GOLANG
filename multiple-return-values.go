func main(){

	//The (int, int) in this function signature shows that the function returns 2 ints

	//Here we use the 2 different return values from the call with multiple assignment

	//If you only want a subset of the returned values, use the blank identifier _

}

//Accepting a variable number of arguments is another nice feature of Go functions
