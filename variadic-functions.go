// Hereâ€™s a function that will take an arbitrary number of ints as arguments

func main(){
	//Variadic functions can be called in the usual way with individual arguments
	
	//If you already have multiple args in a slice, apply them to a variadic function using func(slice...) like this
}

//Another key aspect of functions in Go is their ability to form closures
